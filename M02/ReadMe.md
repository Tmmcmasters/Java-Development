# Exercise 4.1
4.1 (GEOMETRY: AREA OF A PENTAGON) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the length from the center of a pentagon to a vertex and computes the area of the pentagon, as shown in the following figure.


The formula for computing the area of a pentagon is Area = (5 x s^2 )/ (4 x tan (pi/5)) where s is the length of a side. The side can be computed using the formula s = 2rsin(pi/5) where r is the length from the center of a pentagon to a vertex. Round up two digits after the decimal point. Here is a sample run:



Enter the length from the center to a vertex: 5.5 
The area of the pentagon is 71.92
